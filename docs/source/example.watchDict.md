# watchDict file

## Description

A watchDict is a file in C++ dictionary format used with cosim and watchCosim.

A watchDict is suitabble for
* monitor the prgress of a running cosim simulation
* show a self defined convergence plot on the screen and save the image
* write a statistical summary of the results (as the are defined in watchDIct and as far as the progress of the simulation is).

A comprehensive watchDict is written during opsCaseBuilder's build process covering all information from the involved fmu'.
The user has the choice to reduce the content and also to write it by hand or within any other process.
